        <p>Pad Thai has been a staple for the Dallas Cowboys, ever since I have been playing with them
            The recipe has been passed down for generations in my family. I have not even shared the recipe
            with the Cowboys, which has resulted in a few allergic reactions. 
        </p>

        <li>Stir Fry:: Heat 1Â½ tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan or wok over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp, chicken or tofu, garlic and bell pepper.
